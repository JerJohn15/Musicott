Musicott is an application that manages and plays music files. Coded in Java 8 with JavaFX.
Uses [JAudioTagger](https://bitbucket.org/ijabz/jaudiotagger "jAudioTagger") to read and write the metadata,
[Json-io](https://github.com/jdereg/json-io "Json-io") for persistence,
[TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX "TestFx") for testing, and some components from
[ControlsFx](https://bitbucket.org/controlsfx/controlsfx/ "ControlsFx").

Next version 0.9 is almost prepared but it needs more tests (as always)! Community help is welcomed ;)
